# Configuration
The server side applications are configured using configuration file (`config.json`), which is placed in same folder as where the application binaries are. You can use `config.template.json` as base by copying it to `config.json`. 

The can contain multiple configuration sections depending on application. There's one section per service (Collector, DataBroker, Mqtt) and also logging section can be used. Vahti.App.Full contains all services in one app, so its configuration file must contain all sections.

## MqttConfiguration
It's simple. Either the MQTT service is enabled or not. If you don't have another MQTT service running, then this should be true. MQTT service is a hub for published MQTT messages containing sensor data.
|Property|Purpose|
|--------|-------|
|mqttConfigurationEnabled|Indicates if MQTT server is enabled|

```
"mqttConfiguration": {
    "mqttServerEnabled": true
  },
```


## DataBrokerConfiguration
DataBroker is responsible for gathering the measurement data published by another MQTT clients. DataBroker is an MQTT client itself. Disable this makes sense in situations where Vahti.App.Full is used, but not all of its functionality, so for example the DataBroker is running on different machine than other part. If not alerts are configured the whole `alertConfiguration` section can be removed.

|Property|Purpose|
|--------|-------|
|dataBrokerConfigurationEnabled|Indicates if data broker service is enabled|
|mqttServerAddress|Address of the MQTT server|
|stopOnRepeatedErrors|Indicates if service should stop if repeated errors occur|
|cloudPublishConfiguration|Cloud publishing configuration|


### CloudPublishConfiguration
Defines cloud database access details and how often data is published.

|Property|Purpose|
|--------|-------|
|Enabled|Indicates if cloud publishing is enabled|
|updateIntervalMinutes|How often (in minutes) to update current measurement data to cloud|
|historyUpdateIntervalMinutes|History data publish interval in minutes. Currently this is not very useful, because history data is aggregated for each hour|
|historyLengthDays|How many days of measurement history to publish|
|firebaseStorage|Configuration of Firebase database|

#### FirebaseStorage
Google Firebase access details

|Property|Purpose|
|--------|-------|
|enabled|Indicates if Firebase storage is enabled|
|url|URL of the Firebase database where data is stored|
|databaseSecret|Database secret used to access database. Is found in `Project settings\Service accounts\Database secrets` in Firebase Console|

### AlertConfiguration
Alert configuration defines the alerts to be sent and how are they sent. If alerts are not needed, the section can be removed from configuration file.

|Property|Purpose|
|--------|-------|
|azurePushNotifications|Configuration of Azure push notifications|
|emailNotifications|Configuration of email notifications|
|alerts|Configuration of alerts|

#### AzurePushNotifications

|Property|Purpose|
|--------|-------|
|Enabled|Indicates if Azure push notifications are enabled|
|connectionString|Full access connection string to access Azure Notification Hub|
|notificationHubName|Name of the Azure Notification Hub|

#### EmailNotifications

|sender|Sender of the email|
|recipients|Recipients of the email notification|
|smtpServerAddress|Address of the SMTP server|
|smtpServerPort|Port of the SMTP server|
|authentication|SMTP authentication configuration|

##### SmtpAuthentication
Authentication configuration related to SMTP server. Set `enabled` to `false` if SMTP server does not require authentication.
|Property|Purpose|
|--------|-------|
|enabled|Indicates if SMTP authentication is enabled|
|userName|User name to connect the SMTP server|
|password|Password to connect the SMTP server|

#### Alerts
Contains list of alerts
|Property|Purpose|
|--------|-------|
|id|Unique id of the alert|
|description|Description for alert|
|title|Title/subject of the notification message to be sent|
|message|Body text of the notification message to be sent|
|ruleSet|The rules to define when alert notification needs to be sent|

##### RuleSet
`type` defines how rules are handled. Two options for value are `AND` and `OR`. Earlier means that all rules must be true before sending alert and latter means that alert is send when any of the rules is true.

Three operator types are supported: `AreEqualTo`, `IsGreaterThan` and `IsLessThan`
|Property|Purpose|
|--------|-------|
|location|Location where sensor is|
|sensorDeviceId|ID of the sensor device|
|sensorId|ID of the sensor|
|operator|Operator type|

### Logging
Optional logging section provide way to configure what information is logged in console. See [Logging in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/?view=aspnetcore-3.1) for more details. Setting log level `Debug` for Vahti, you'll getmore  detailed information about collected/published data.

```
"Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Vahti": "Information",
      "System": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Information"
    },
    "Console": {
